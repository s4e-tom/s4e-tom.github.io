I've been interested in computer sciences since middle school and have been studying them for four years now, at Universit√© de Bordeaux.

I hope that in the future I will be able to work on videogames. I'm currently a member of the videogame development association [Flat226](http://www.flat226.fr/), although life and studies don't leave me enough time to contribute as much as I'd want to.

Favorite band: The Raveonettes  
Favorite games: Super Smash Bros. and Guilty Gear  
Hobbies: papercraft and badminton  
Other stuff: I act in a theater company.
