title: Nuit de l'info 2014

I participated in Nuit de l'info 2014 at Bordeaux with team Les Programmateurs. We managed to get a few awards, and we even won the WebGL contest with our serious game "Be a savior!".

You can find it in my works page (which is finally available! It's still pretty much WIP for now, but it looks alright).
